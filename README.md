# Data-Science-Trading-Project
This is a project done on the S&amp;P 500, where I expand from SMA data to more complex indicators such as RSI. I intend to expand and grow this project over time, and will hopefully utilise machine learning to influence predictions.
There will be recorded updates of progression throughout, where you can see how the project has evolved over time.
